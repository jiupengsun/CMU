mdriver, mdriver-emulate
        Once you've run make, run ./mdriver to test
        your solution.  Run ./mdriver-emulate to make sure your
        solution can handle 64-bit allocations

traces/
	Directory that contains the trace files that the driver uses
	to test your solution. Files with names of the form XXX-short.rep
	contain very short traces that you can use for debugging.

**********************************
Other support files for the driver
**********************************
config.h	Configures the malloc lab driver
fsecs.{c,h}	Wrapper function for the different timer packages
clock.{c,h}	Routines for accessing the x86-64 cycle counters
fcyc.{c,h}	Timer functions based on cycle counters
ftimer.{c,h}	Timer functions based on interval timers and gettimeofday()
memlib.{c,h}	Models the heap and sbrk function
stree.{c,h}     Data structure used by the driver to check for
		overlapping allocations
Contech.so	Code that combines with LLVM compiler infrastructure
		to enable sparse memory emulation
macro-check.pl  Code to check for disallowed macro definitions
driver.pl	Runs both mdriver and mdriver-emulate and generates
		the autolab result.  (Not included with checkpoint)

***********************
Example malloc packages
***********************
mm.c            Empty malloc package
mm-naive.c      Fast but extremely memory-inefficient package
mm-baseline.c   Implicit-list allocator to use as starting point

*******************************
Building and running the driver
*******************************
To build the driver, type "make" to the shell.

To run the driver on a tiny test trace:

	unix> ./mdriver -V -f traces/malloc.rep

To get a list of the driver flags:

	unix> ./mdriver -h

The -V option prints out helpful tracing information

You can use mdriver-emulate to test the correctness of your code in
handling 64-bit addresses:

	unix> ./mdriver-emulate

You should see the exact same utilization numbers as you did with the
regular driver.  No timing is done, and so the time and throughput
numbers show up as zeros.
